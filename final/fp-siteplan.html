          <div>
            <p>
              Would you like to find your ancestors without having to do too
              much digging? Have you been frustrated looking up names on
              FamilySearch? <br/>I have spent hours searching and have found little
              or nothing. With a true and reliable index, people wouldn't have
              to spend hours reading through a tome of images hoping to find an
              ancestor. I want to create a page where the minimum information
              necessary to identify everyone contained in the images that
              FamilySearch has is recorded, especially in those areas in which
              all the records have not yet been indexed.</p>
              <p>With <strong>Genealogical Index</strong> 
              you can filter by first name, last name, date and type of event,
              city, state, and country. You'll also be able to see a list of
              similar first and last names and you'll be able to decide if any
              of them were misspelled but sound like the one you're looking for.
              <p>Notes: Some people think that this would be a very effective way
              to find ancestors. Others think they would like to find a simple
              way to index, without entering too much information, but still
              find a record.</p>

          <h2>TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              The audience is made up of people of both sexes with average ages
              between 18 to 50 years old, as well as family groups.
            </p>

              I will add a table with information from some general records of Mexico and Venezuela. The table will be styled using bootstrap and an additional Javascript library called bootstrap-table which allows you to filter data by headers, making it easier to look up names. Once a name of interest is located, a direct link to the image or record in FamilySearch will be clickable.
            </p>

              In addition to the HOME page, I will create two other pages. Both pages will contain a table with a list of names and lastnames found on the main page.
            </p>
            <p>That way, people searching for a surname or given name would be able to see if there is any variant of the one they're looking for and make their search easier.</p>
